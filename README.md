## 💰 Top 3 Identified Combinations & Potential Budget

The following combinations were identified as having the highest total profit, but this profit is deemed **unstable** due to associated risk factors.

| Rank | State-Month Combination | Total Profit (SUM) | Recommended Ad Spend (20% of Profit) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **#1** | **Indiana - October** | $9,004 | **$1,800.80** |
| **#2** | **Vermont - November** | $1,192 | **$238.40** |
| **#3** | **Washington - March** | $23,460 | **$4,692.00** |
| | **TOTAL IDENTIFIED SPEND** | **$33,656** | **$6,731.20** |

## 🔍 Supporting Analysis: Risk & Contradiction

The analysis shifted from an initial recommendation to a **critical risk assessment** based on the following findings:

1.  **High Risk Investment (Contradiction):** The **Avg Profit vs Avg Return Rate** scatter plot shows that all three combinations are situated in a high return rate range (0.2 - 0.4), indicating a volatile investment area.
2.  **Customer Reliability:** Products are sold to a generally reliable customer base (e.g., Aaron Bergman, Aaron Hawkins). This suggests the high return issues are rooted in the **fulfillment or quality control process** specific to these states/months rather than customer behavior.
3.  **Targeted Risk:** While specific customers like **Hilary Holden** and **Roland Murray** show 100% return rates, the high average profit in Washington ($521.30) makes it a primary candidate for operational improvement before marketing.

## Conclusion and Next Steps

Based on the conflicting data—high SUM(Profit) in Washington versus high return risk—it is recommended that the **$6,731.20** ad budget be temporarily **held**. The company should first execute a deep dive into the **fulfillment and quality control issues** specific to Indiana in October, Vermont in November, and Washington in March. Only after the return risk is stabilized should the targeted advertising campaigns be launched.
